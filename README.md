# Hello, everyone!
My name is Isaiah. I'm a college freshman (as of writing this) who is majoring in Computer science.

My goal for the future is to make video games by meshing my hobbies together! Music production, creative writing, and game development are three of my biggest hobbies that I flip between.

This account will host all of my academic projects, and perhaps even personal projects! I'm currently learning Unix and C++.
